DIP — Dependency Inversion Principle
High-level modules/classes should not depend on low-level modules/classes. Both should depend upon abstractions.
This principle is all about the loose coupling of your classes making them more
localized and connecting them with abstract class.
It’s better to connect the high-level class to the low level via abstract class.
