O - OCP - Open/Closed Principle

Definition: Class should be open for extension but closed for modification.

Meaning: That once you have built something (like a class or a piece of code),
you should be able to add new features to it without changing the original code to make people who work on the old class don't be affected.

Imagine you are an architect creating blueprints for different types of houses.
Each blueprint represents a unique design with specific rooms and sizes.
Following the Open/Closed Principle means that once you have created a blueprint,
you should be able to add new features, like a home office or a swimming pool, without changing the original blueprint.
This approach ensures that people who work with the original blueprint won't be affected,and you can easily add what you need.
By following this principle, the blueprints become more flexible, making them easier to maintain and adapt to different client requirements.


Example: House Blueprints
In the design of house blueprints, we used to have fixed attributes for each type of house,
like the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, kitchen size, etc. But if we wanted to add new features,
we had to modify the existing blueprint, which could lead to errors and affect other house designs.

Now, by following the Open/Closed Principle,
we create a base blueprint with essential attributes.
Additionally, we provide extension options for specific features,
such as a home office, swimming pool, library room, or gym room. With this approach,
we can easily include these extensions in a blueprint without changing the original design.
Clients can now request houses with additional features without affecting the core structure of the original blueprint.
This makes the blueprints more adaptable and customizable, allowing us to efficiently design houses tailored to individual
preferences while keeping the original design intact.
