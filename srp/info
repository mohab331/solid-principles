S - SRP - Single Responsibility Principle
Definition: A class should only have one reason to change, meaning it should be responsible for one thing or have a "single responsibility."

Example: Let's imagine we are building a house. We have different workers with specific roles:

a) Carpenter: Responsible for building and installing wooden structures like doors, cabinets, and wooden flooring.

b) Plumber: Responsible for installing plumbing fixtures like pipes, sinks, and toilets.

c) Electrician: Responsible for installing the electrical wiring, switches, and fixtures.

Each worker focuses on their role and responsibility, ensuring that the work is done efficiently.
If a change is needed in the wooden structures, it will be the responsibility of the carpenter,
and it won't affect the plumbing or electrical work, and vice versa.
This division of responsibilities makes it easy to identify who to approach to fix specific issues, resulting in a more organized and maintainable construction process.
